#### [1.1.4] - 2018-04-25

- Added command command to stay awake. This cancels the screen timeout
- Added modulemap can now be a set of modules
- Added command to hide all modules except the selected one. This can be a set from the modulemap so 
    effectively this can be used to show named pages

#### [1.1.3] - 2018-04-20

- Added Google TTS. Many more languages available than pico2tts
  Command conversation can now be in languages other than en-GB,de-DE,es-ES,fr-FR,it-IT like nl-NL
- Added config switch to choose between pico and Google TTS
- Fixed one more bug in GA. Saying "nevermind" just stopped the conversation without returning to listening mode

#### [1.1.2] - 2018-04-20

- Added timeout for screen
- Added screen section in config to specify timeout and screen on/off commands

#### [1.1.1] - 2018-04-19

- Changed handling of config.js so it is now backwards compatible

- Added commands for showing/hiding a single named module
